# *stanCode SC101* project

This repository shows my programming projects done during the period of stanCode SC101 course. (more about [stanCode](https://stancode.tw/))
- Includes: Breakout Game, Image Separation, Search Babynames, Recursion and Boggle game solver.
These small projects strengthen my understanding of the Python language.\
In the SC101 course, I learned some fundamental knowledge about coding like Object Orientation, Game Production, Data Structures, Data Processing, Recursion, and some Search Algorithms.




## Projects
### Breakout game
 - This is a simple breakout game build by campy packages.(Learning the concepts of Object-orientation and classes in Python.)
 - Please run breakout.py to start the game.

### Image processing
 - This is a program that can erase unexpected people on the image by choosing the best pixel between several images in same sizes.
 - Please use terminal to execute this program and use the directory of images name as params.(os = window) ex. py myPhotoshop.py hoover 

### Babynames
 - This is a simple full-stack project that user can type any english name to show how popular this name is from 1900s to 2010s.
 - Please run babynames.py to start this program.
 
### sierpinski triangle
 - This is a program that can draw the sierpinski triangle by the concept of recursion in Python.
 - Please run sierpinski.py to start the project.

### Boggle game solver
 - This is a program that can quickly find all possible words on any boggle board.(Practicing the concept of Backtracking Algorithms )
